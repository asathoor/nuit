Nuit - a WordPress Childtheme with Nodejs features
==================================================

## A **WordPress in the Classroom** theme

>This theme is one of the three themes I made for my book [WordPress in the Classroom](http://ipaper.ipapercms.dk/ErhvervsakademiAarhus/Forskningsrapportguides/wordpress-in-the-classroom/). The themes are not made for production. They are made for the classroom, that is for students, developers and teachers learning the [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org) craft and code. 

## A fork of tw17child

This childtheme is a fork of my [tw17child](https://github.com/asathoor/tw17child). This theme will implement certain features from Nodejs, such as Bower, Gulp, Sass and other usefull libraries. 

Nuit demonstrates rapid development with Nodejs.

## Nodejs features
